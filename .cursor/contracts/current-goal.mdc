# Current Goal

**Goal:** Framework showcase (weekend side-quest)  
**Reference:** Plan — Weekend Framework Side-Quest  
**Summary:** Make the agentic framework discoverable, runnable, and documented for technically-oriented visitors. Three gate contracts: Framework Playground, Developer Guide, Open Source Polish. PoC goal is **suspended until Sunday 2026-02-23.**

## Weekend Side-Quest — Urgency Map

| Tier | Contract | Status | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| **gate** | `framework-playground` (Contract A) | active | `examples/framework/` — runnable demo of all framework concepts. Zero RP dependency. |
| **gate** | `framework-developer-guide` (Contract B) | active | `docs/framework-guide.md` — conceptual design document for newcomers. |
| **gate** | `oss-first-impression` (Contract C) | active | LICENSE, README update, CONTRIBUTING.md, `make playground` target. Depends on A + B. |
| **gate** | `metacal-run-1` (Contract D) | active | First empirical meta-calibration: model discovery via prompt negation + refactoring probe per model. `pkg/framework/metacal/`. |

## Suspended Goal: PoC completion

**Resumes:** Sunday 2026-02-23  
**Reference:** `goals/poc.mdc`  
**Summary:** Prove Asterisk can do real blind RCA on RP data with both BasicAdapter (heuristic) and CursorAdapter (AI via MCP), push results back to ReportPortal, then tune accuracy through targeted quick wins.

## PoC Urgency Map (suspended)

Ordered by priority within each tier. Agents should work top-down: complete gates before quick-wins; quick-wins before should-haves; should-haves before next-milestone. Re-tiered per Phase 5a mitigation urgency audit (2026-02-19).

### MUST — Blocks PoC gate or pitch

| Tier | Contract | Status | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| **gate** | `rp-e2e-launch` | active | Final PoC gate. BasicAdapter M19=0.83. CursorAdapter Phase 5a FAIL M19=0.50. |
| **gate** | `cursor-prompt-tuning` | active | Prompt fixes to lift CursorAdapter M19 from 0.50 toward 0.85. Taxonomy + component priors. |
| ~~gate~~ | ~~`poc-scope-precision`~~ | **complete** | All 7 tasks done. Moved to `completed/poc-v2/`. |
| ~~gate~~ | ~~`phase-5a-mitigation`~~ | **complete** | Umbrella closed. All 9 tasks done. Moved to `completed/poc-v2/`. |
| ~~gate~~ | ~~`workspace-mvp`~~ | **complete** | 11 tasks done, 5 tests. Moved to `completed/poc-v2/`. |

### SHOULD — Significant PoC quality, pitch polish

Execution order assessed 2026-02-19. Ordered by: dependencies resolved, metric impact, effort. Work top-down.

| Order | Contract | Status | PoC scope | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| ~~1st~~ | ~~`improve-human-operator-output`~~ | **complete** | Full | Narration rules in agent-bus.mdc. Moved to `completed/poc-v2/`. |
| ~~2nd~~ | ~~`logging-standardization`~~ | **complete** | Full | All migrated to `log/slog`. Moved to `completed/poc-v2/`. |
| 2nd | `evidence-gap-brief` | draft | Ph1-3 (types + adapter + output) | Foundational "I don't know because X" infrastructure. Enables tuning QW-4. |
| 4th | `poc-tuning-loop` | draft | QW-1 to QW-4 | Depends on E2E baseline + evidence-gap-brief. QW-1/QW-2 overlap with workspace-mvp. |
| 5th | `origami-ground-truth-ingestor` | draft | **Ph1-2 + Ph7 only** (store + CLI + PR) | Defer Ph3-6 (AI extractors, MCP bridge). Dataset JSON export + GitHub PR. |
| ~~6th~~ | ~~`concurrent-subagents-determinism`~~ | **complete** | Full (4 tasks, test-only) | All 4 tasks done. 4-subagent MCP pipeline drain, zero duplicates, full report. |
| ~~7th~~ | ~~`subagent-testing-framework`~~ | **complete** | Full (9 tasks) | All 9 tasks done. RoutingLog, RoutingRecorder, replay, color-tagged logs. |
| ~~6th~~ | ~~`agent-adapter-overloading`~~ | **abandoned** | — | Phase 1 absorbed by III.1-personae. Phases 2-4 deferred. |
| 6th | `workspace-catalog` | draft | **Defer** | Hard dep on workspace-mvp. Heaviest Go-code. Not PoC-blocking; MVP covers M12/M13. |

## Goal Transition Protocol

When this goal is met (rp-e2e-launch complete + tuning loop stop condition reached):

1. Archive this manifest in `notes/` as `goal-history-poc.md`
2. Create a new `current-goal.mdc` for the next goal (likely: MCP integration)
3. Reassess all draft contracts — re-tier relative to the new goal
4. Move completed contracts to `completed/` with appropriate phase subdirectory
