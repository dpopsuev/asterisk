# Current Goal

**Goal:** PoC completion  
**Reference:** `goals/poc.mdc`  
**Summary:** Prove Asterisk can do real blind RCA on RP data with both BasicAdapter (heuristic) and CursorAdapter (AI via MCP), push results back to ReportPortal, then tune accuracy through targeted quick wins.

## Urgency Map

Ordered by priority within each tier. Agents should work top-down: complete gates before quick-wins; quick-wins before should-haves; should-haves before next-milestone. Re-tiered per Phase 5a mitigation urgency audit (2026-02-19).

### MUST — Blocks PoC gate or pitch

| Tier | Contract | Status | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| **gate** | `rp-e2e-launch` | active | Final PoC gate. BasicAdapter M19=0.83. CursorAdapter Phase 5a FAIL M19=0.50. |
| **gate** | `cursor-prompt-tuning` | active | Prompt fixes to lift CursorAdapter M19 from 0.50 toward 0.85. Taxonomy + component priors. |
| ~~gate~~ | ~~`poc-scope-precision`~~ | **complete** | All 7 tasks done. Moved to `completed/poc-v2/`. |
| ~~gate~~ | ~~`phase-5a-mitigation`~~ | **complete** | Umbrella closed. All 9 tasks done. Moved to `completed/poc-v2/`. |
| ~~gate~~ | ~~`workspace-mvp`~~ | **complete** | 11 tasks done, 5 tests. Moved to `completed/poc-v2/`. |

### SHOULD — Significant PoC quality, pitch polish

Execution order assessed 2026-02-19. Ordered by: dependencies resolved, metric impact, effort. Work top-down.

| Order | Contract | Status | PoC scope | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| 1st | `improve-human-operator-output` | draft | Full (3 tasks, rule only) | Zero deps, zero Go code, 15 min. Every subsequent run benefits. |
| ~~2nd~~ | ~~`logging-standardization`~~ | **complete** | Full | All migrated to `log/slog`. Moved to `completed/poc-v2/`. |
| 2nd | `evidence-gap-brief` | draft | Ph1-3 (types + adapter + output) | Foundational "I don't know because X" infrastructure. Enables tuning QW-4. |
| 4th | `poc-tuning-loop` | draft | QW-1 to QW-4 | Depends on E2E baseline + evidence-gap-brief. QW-1/QW-2 overlap with workspace-mvp. |
| 5th | `origami-ground-truth-ingestor` | draft | **Ph1-2 + Ph7 only** (store + CLI + PR) | Defer Ph3-6 (AI extractors, MCP bridge). Dataset JSON export + GitHub PR. |
| ~~6th~~ | ~~`concurrent-subagents-determinism`~~ | **complete** | Full (4 tasks, test-only) | All 4 tasks done. 4-subagent MCP pipeline drain, zero duplicates, full report. |
| ~~7th~~ | ~~`subagent-testing-framework`~~ | **complete** | Full (9 tasks) | All 9 tasks done. RoutingLog, RoutingRecorder, replay, color-tagged logs. |
| 6th | `agent-adapter-overloading` | draft | **Phase 1 only** (pool + scheduler) | Defer Ph2-4 (escalation, tournament, learned). Color identity for pitch demo. |
| 7th | `workspace-catalog` | draft | **Defer or full** | Hard dep on workspace-mvp. Heaviest Go-code. Not PoC-blocking; MVP covers M12/M13. |

### Completed

| Tier | Contract | Status | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| ~~quick-win~~ | ~~`data-swipe`~~ | **complete** | Scrubbed. Moved to active-complete status. |
| ~~quick-win~~ | ~~`architecture-snapshots`~~ | **complete** | 11 diagrams across 4 files. Moved to `completed/knowledge-store/`. |
| ~~quick-win~~ | ~~`fsc-knowledge-compartmentalization`~~ | **complete** | 4 compartments, 3 alwaysApply. Moved to `completed/knowledge-store/`. |
| ~~vision~~ | ~~`soul-red-hat-telco`~~ | **complete** | Red Hat identity, telco mission, OSS philosophy. Moved to `completed/knowledge-store/`. |

### NICE — Architecture evolution, post-PoC

| Tier | Contract | Status | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| **next-milestone** | `mcp-server-foundation` | draft | MCP chain step 1. `asterisk serve` over stdio. |
| **next-milestone** | `mcp-pipeline-tools` | draft | MCP chain step 2. F0-F6 pipeline tools. |
| **next-milestone** | `mcp-calibration-mode` | draft | MCP chain step 3. Calibration-specific MCP tools. |
| **vision** | `workspace-revisited` | draft | Long-term workspace vision: layered composition, dependency graph, summarization. Trimmed to Phases 3-4. |
| ~~vision — Framework Tome I~~ | ~~`agentic-framework-I.1-ontology`~~ | **complete** | Node/Edge/Walker/Graph interfaces in `internal/framework/`. Moved to `completed/framework/`. |
| ~~vision — Framework Tome I~~ | ~~`agentic-framework-I.2-characteristica`~~ | **complete** | Pipeline DSL (YAML/Go). Orchestrate bridge. Moved to `completed/framework/`. |

## Goal Transition Protocol

When this goal is met (rp-e2e-launch complete + tuning loop stop condition reached):

1. Archive this manifest in `notes/` as `goal-history-poc.md`
2. Create a new `current-goal.mdc` for the next goal (likely: MCP integration)
3. Reassess all draft contracts — re-tier relative to the new goal
4. Move completed contracts to `completed/` with appropriate phase subdirectory
