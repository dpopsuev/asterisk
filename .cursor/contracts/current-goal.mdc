# Current Goal

**Goal:** Polishing & Presentation  
**Summary:** The PoC proved Asterisk works. Now make it shine. Asterisk should be a lean, impressive sports car — when viewers see it, they think "Wow, Sundays and Mondays are now for real work." Origami is the engine reveal: a stable, polished API that opens a new world of agentic pipeline orchestration. Both repos must be presentation-ready.

## Vision

**Asterisk (the car):** Lean domain tool. Every line of code serves the RCA mission. No dead weight, no framework leakage, no rough edges. The CLI, the output, the calibration results — all must evoke confidence. "This thing just works."

**Origami (the engine):** Stable API surface. Clean documentation. The playground runs, the DSL is expressive, the concepts (Elements, Personas, Masks, Dialectic) are coherent and discoverable. When the hood opens, people find something they didn't know existed.

## PoC Results (proven)

| Adapter | Scenario | M19 | Key metrics | Notes |
|---------|----------|-----|-------------|-------|
| BasicAdapter | ptp-real-ingest (18 verified) | **0.83** | M1=1.00, M2=1.00, M15=0.72 | Heuristic baseline. 19/21 metrics pass. |
| CursorAdapter | ptp-real-ingest (18 verified) | **0.58** | M2=0.78, M8=0.60, M14b=0.30 | AI baseline. 10/21 pass. Root causes documented. |

## Execution Order

Critical path: `consumer-ergonomics` (Origami) → `walker-experience` (Origami) → `ouroboros-seed-pipeline` (Origami) → `kami-live-debugger` (Origami) → `kabuki-presentation-engine` (Origami) → `demo-presentation` (Asterisk).

Strategic pauses (CHECKPOINT) verify Asterisk still works after Origami API changes. Asterisk imports Origami as a Go module — every Origami change can silently break the consumer.

### Sprint 1 — Foundation (parallel)

| # | Contract | Repo | Tier | Notes |
|---|----------|------|------|-------|
| 1 | `consumer-ergonomics` | Origami | nice | Smallest scope. Stabilizes walker factory conventions. Quick win. |
| 2 | `knowledge-source-migration` | **Asterisk** | should | Removes stale `origami/workspace` imports. Prerequisite for clean build. Parallel with #1. |
| 3 | `ground-truth-dataset` Ph7 | **Asterisk** | should | JSON export for presentation-ready dataset. Parallel with #1. |

### CHECKPOINT A — Asterisk health after foundation

```
Origami:  go build ./... && go test ./...
Asterisk: go get github.com/dpopsuev/origami@latest
          go build ./... && go test ./...
          just calibrate-stub
```

Verify: Asterisk compiles with latest Origami. Stub calibration still passes. No regressions from `knowledge-source-migration` or Origami API changes.

### Sprint 2 — Walker experience

| # | Contract | Repo | Tier | Notes |
|---|----------|------|------|-------|
| 4 | `walker-experience` | Origami | should | WalkerDef + MemoryStore. High demo impact — "define agents in YAML." Depends on #1. |

### CHECKPOINT B — Asterisk health after DSL extension

```
Origami:  go build ./... && go test ./...
Asterisk: go get github.com/dpopsuev/origami@latest
          go build ./... && go test ./...
          just calibrate-stub
```

Verify: WalkerDef addition to PipelineDef doesn't break Asterisk's existing pipeline loading. `LoadPipeline` still works with Asterisk's YAML (which has no `walkers:` section). MemoryStore import is available but not required.

### Sprint 3 — Ouroboros redesign (largest)

| # | Contract | Repo | Tier | Notes |
|---|----------|------|------|-------|
| 5 | `ouroboros-seed-pipeline` | Origami | should | Largest contract. Seeds, 3-node pipeline, PersonaSheet, auto-routing. Core of engine reveal. Depends on #4. |

### CHECKPOINT C — Asterisk health after Ouroboros overhaul

```
Origami:  go build ./... && go test ./...
Asterisk: go get github.com/dpopsuev/origami@latest
          go build ./... && go test ./...
          just calibrate-stub
          just calibrate-wet --cases 3
```

Verify: Ouroboros API changes (deprecated runner, new pipeline path) don't break Asterisk's meta-calibration integration. Wet calibration on 3 cases confirms the full stack still works end-to-end. This is the most critical checkpoint — Ouroboros touches the deepest framework layer. **E2E gate (Origami):** `go test -run TestE2E ./...` runs all scenario YAMLs + real-YAML walks.

### Sprint 4 — Kami debugger

| # | Contract | Repo | Tier | Notes |
|---|----------|------|------|-------|
| 6 | `kami-live-debugger` | Origami | should | Presentation-critical. Live graph visualization is the demo centerpiece. Pipeline layer must be stable (#5). |

### CHECKPOINT D — Asterisk health before demo integration

```
Origami:  go build ./... && go test ./...
Asterisk: go get github.com/dpopsuev/origami@latest
          go build ./... && go test ./...
          just calibrate-stub
```

Verify: Kami's EventBridge, KamiServer, and new MCP tools don't break Asterisk's existing MCP server. SignalBus changes are backward-compatible. This is the last checkpoint before starting the demo — Asterisk must be rock solid.

### Sprint 5 — Presentation engine + Demo (COMPLETE)

| # | Contract | Repo | Tier | Status |
|---|----------|------|------|--------|
| 7a | `kabuki-presentation-engine` | Origami | should | **Complete.** KabukiConfig interface, 3 API endpoints, 12 section components, element selector, scroll-snap + keyboard nav. |
| 7b | `demo-presentation` | **Asterisk** | should | **Complete.** PoliceStationKabuki + PoliceStationTheme, `asterisk demo` CLI, integration tests. Phase 3 (canonical recording) deferred. |

### CHECKPOINT E — PASSED

```
Origami:  go build ./... && go test ./...         ✓
Asterisk: go build ./... && go test ./...         ✓
          just calibrate-stub                      ✓ (19/19, M19=0.99)
```

Canonical recording deferred to wet calibration session. Wet calibration (`just calibrate-wet --cases 3`) deferred to same session.

### Sprint 6 — LSP (Origami, post-demo)

| # | Contract | Repo | Tier | Notes |
|---|----------|------|------|-------|
| — | `origami-lsp` | Origami | vision | Language Server for pipeline YAML. Color coding, virtual text hints, Kami live connection. Last goal. |

**CHECKPOINT F** — LSP validates all E2E scenario YAMLs. No Asterisk changes — Origami-only.

### Post-presentation polish (no checkpoints needed)

| # | Contract | Repo | Tier | Notes |
|---|----------|------|------|-------|
| 8 | `provider-resilience` | Origami | nice | Fallback chains + intent classifier. Polishes dispatch layer. |
| 9 | `evidence-gap-brief` | **Asterisk** | nice | Structured "I don't know" output. Polish, not blocking. |
| 10 | `domain-calibration` | Origami | nice | Per-domain eval types. Useful but not presentation-critical. |
| 11 | `prompt-calibration` | Origami | nice | Deferred. No urgency until post-presentation tuning. |
| 12 | `knowledge-source-evolution` | **Asterisk** | vision | Long-term architecture. No timeline. |
| 13 | `origami-collections` | Origami | vision | Package manager + collection format. Prevents consumer duplication. No timeline. |

## What "presentation-ready" means

### Asterisk
- [x] Zero stale imports (no `origami/workspace` references)
- [x] Clean `go vet ./...`, `go build ./...`, `go test ./...`
- [ ] README tells the story: problem, solution, results (M19 numbers)
- [x] `asterisk calibrate` demo runs cleanly with meaningful output
- [x] Ground truth dataset is JSON (reviewable), not just Go structs

### Origami
- [ ] `examples/playground/` runs and demonstrates all concepts
- [ ] API surface is stable — no breaking changes pending
- [ ] `docs/framework-guide.md` is current and coherent
- [ ] Test coverage on public API is solid
- [ ] README positions Origami as a standalone framework

## Goal Transition Protocol

When presentation is delivered:

1. Archive this manifest in `notes/` as `goal-history-polish.md`
2. Create a new `current-goal.mdc` for the next goal
3. Reassess all draft contracts — re-tier relative to the new goal
