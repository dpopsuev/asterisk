# Current Goal

**Goal:** 100% DSL — Zero Go  
**Summary:** Asterisk is a playbook repository. There is no Python in an Ansible repo — only YAML. The Python lives in Ansible (the engine) and in collections (the plugins). Asterisk follows the same model: **zero Go code.** The Go lives in Origami (the engine) and in Origami's adapters/marbles (the collections). Achilles is a sibling playbook repository — both are analysis tools on Origami, differing only in domain (CI post-mortem vs. security probing). Any Go code in Asterisk is a signal that the framework or its adapters are missing a primitive.

## The ROI That Changes Everything

$1 per 20 cases saves 10 people an accumulated 10 days of work.

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AI cost per batch | ~$1 |
| Labor savings per batch | ~$50,000 |
| ROI | **50,000x** |

**Implication:** Accuracy dominates. Token budget is irrelevant. A system that costs $5 instead of $1 but gets the answer right saves $49,995.

## PoC Results (baseline)

| Adapter | Scenario | M19 | Key metrics | Notes |
|---------|----------|-----|-------------|-------|
| BasicAdapter | ptp-real-ingest (18 verified) | **0.83** | M1=1.00, M2=1.00, M15=0.72 | Heuristic baseline. 19/21 metrics pass. |
| CursorAdapter | ptp-real-ingest (18 verified) | **0.58** | M2=0.78, M8=0.60, M14b=0.30 | AI baseline. 10/21 pass. |

## Active Contracts

| Contract | Tier | Scope |
|----------|------|-------|
| `rca-pure-dsl` | gate | Marble discovery: decompose `adapters/rca/` (40+ files, 6K LOC) into reusable Origami marbles, validated by Achilles. |
| `data-dsl-extraction` | should | Scenarios + vocabulary to YAML; zero Go struct literals for ground truth data. |
| `adapter-migration` | should | RP adapter lift-and-drop to Origami. |
| `sqlite-dsl-adapter` | should | YAML-defined SQLite adapter in Origami (schema, migrations, CRUD transformers). |

### Execution order

```
    ┌───────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ rca-pure-dsl (gate)                   │  ← marble discovery first
    │ data-dsl-extraction (should)          │  ← scenarios + vocabulary to YAML
    │ adapter-migration (should)            │  ← RP adapter to Origami
    │ sqlite-dsl-adapter (should)           │  ← YAML-defined SQLite in Origami
    └───────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Open Checklist

- [ ] CursorAdapter M19 >= 0.70 with principled weights (baseline: 0.58)
- [ ] M14b (smoking gun) confirmed >= 0.30 in wet run (baseline: 0.30 — at threshold)
- [ ] **Zero Go (umbrella):** Asterisk repo contains zero `.go` files. Validated by: `data-dsl-extraction` + `adapter-migration` + `sqlite-dsl-adapter` + `rca-pure-dsl`.

## Completed Work

All prior goals achieved. Bundles 1-4 (Principled Metrics, Rich Names, Smart Routing, Demo Polish) complete. Standalone contracts (internal-cleanup, data-ingestion, evidence-gap-brief, knowledge-source-evolution) complete. Origami framework items (DefaultMetrics, DefaultScoreCard, CostBill, CostConfig, calibration DSL pipeline, LSP validation, EvidenceSource rename, probe stimuli, mathutil extraction) all verified.

## Goal Transition Protocol

When zero Go is achieved:

1. Archive this manifest in `notes/` as `goal-history-100-dsl.md`
2. Evaluate next goal: production hardening, multi-operator expansion, or community release
3. Reassess all draft contracts — re-tier relative to the next goal
