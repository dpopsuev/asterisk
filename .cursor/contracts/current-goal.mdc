# Current Goal

**Goal:** PoC completion (resumed)  
**Summary:** Prove Asterisk can do real blind RCA on RP data with both BasicAdapter (heuristic) and CursorAdapter (AI via MCP). Framework showcase contracts (A, B, C) moved to `github.com/dpopsuev/origami`.

## Asterisk Domain — Urgency Map

| Tier | Contract | Status | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| ~~gate~~ | ~~`distillation-endgame`~~ | **complete** | All 3 phases done. Pipeline uses Runner.Walk(), dispatch via origami/dispatch. |
| ~~gate~~ | ~~`asterisk-origami-distillation`~~ | **complete** | Boundary validated. Achilles built. Moved to `completed/distillation/`. |
| **next-milestone** | Origami DSL (5 contracts) | active (C1) | Evolves Origami into declarative pipeline DSL. Asterisk shrinks from ~18k to ~3k lines Go. See `origami/.cursor/contracts/current-goal.mdc`. |

Framework contracts (playground, developer guide, OSS polish, Tomes I-IV, MCP, multi-subagent) moved to `github.com/dpopsuev/origami/.cursor/contracts/`.

## Suspended Goal: PoC completion

**Resumes:** Sunday 2026-02-23  
**Reference:** `goals/poc.mdc`  
**Summary:** Prove Asterisk can do real blind RCA on RP data with both BasicAdapter (heuristic) and CursorAdapter (AI via MCP), push results back to ReportPortal, then tune accuracy through targeted quick wins.

## PoC Urgency Map (suspended)

Ordered by priority within each tier. Agents should work top-down: complete gates before quick-wins; quick-wins before should-haves; should-haves before next-milestone. Re-tiered per Phase 5a mitigation urgency audit (2026-02-19).

### MUST — Blocks PoC gate or pitch

| Tier | Contract | Status | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| ~~gate~~ | ~~`asterisk-papercup-v2-hardening`~~ | **complete** | Embedded v2 choreography into MCP server + skill. Companion: `origami-papercup-v2-hardening`. Moved to `completed/calibration/`. |
| **gate** | `asterisk-calibrate-skill` | active | MCP-based Cursor Skill for wet calibration. Skill rewritten to v2 supervisor pattern; needs wet validation. |
| **gate** | `rp-e2e-launch` | active | Final PoC gate. BasicAdapter M19=0.83. CursorAdapter Phase 5a FAIL M19=0.50. |
| **gate** | `domain-cursor-prompt-tuning` | active | Prompt fixes to lift CursorAdapter M19 from 0.50 toward 0.85. Taxonomy + component priors. |
| ~~gate~~ | ~~`wet-calibration-tuning`~~ | **complete** | Dry M19: 0.49 → 0.74. Terminology corrected: runs were dry, not wet. |
| **gate** | `m3-m9-tuning` | active | Lift M3 (recall) from 0.33→0.70, M9 (repo precision) from 0.62→0.70. |
| **gate** | `efficiency-m16-m17-m18-tuning` | active | Path/loops/tokens. Depends on M3 fix. M16: 0.42→0.60, M17: 8→[0.5,2.0], M18: 91k→60k. |
| ~~gate~~ | ~~`poc-scope-precision`~~ | **complete** | All 7 tasks done. Moved to `completed/poc-v2/`. |
| ~~gate~~ | ~~`phase-5a-mitigation`~~ | **complete** | Umbrella closed. All 9 tasks done. Moved to `completed/poc-v2/`. |
| ~~gate~~ | ~~`workspace-mvp`~~ | **complete** | 11 tasks done, 5 tests. Moved to `completed/poc-v2/`. |

### SHOULD — Significant PoC quality, pitch polish

Execution order assessed 2026-02-19. Ordered by: dependencies resolved, metric impact, effort. Work top-down.

| Order | Contract | Status | PoC scope | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| ~~1st~~ | ~~`improve-human-operator-output`~~ | **complete** | Full | Narration rules in agent-bus.mdc. Moved to `completed/poc-v2/`. |
| ~~2nd~~ | ~~`logging-standardization`~~ | **complete** | Full | All migrated to `log/slog`. Moved to `completed/poc-v2/`. |
| 2nd | `evidence-gap-brief` | draft | Ph1-3 (types + adapter + output) | Foundational "I don't know because X" infrastructure. Enables tuning QW-4. |
| 4th | `poc-tuning-loop` | draft | QW-1 to QW-4 | Depends on E2E baseline + evidence-gap-brief. QW-1/QW-2 overlap with workspace-mvp. |
| 5th | `origami-ground-truth-ingestor` | draft | **Ph1-2 + Ph7 only** (store + CLI + PR) | Defer Ph3-6 (AI extractors, MCP bridge). Dataset JSON export + GitHub PR. |
| ~~6th~~ | ~~`concurrent-subagents-determinism`~~ | **complete** | — | Moved to Origami repo. |
| ~~7th~~ | ~~`subagent-testing-framework`~~ | **complete** | — | Moved to Origami repo. |
| ~~6th~~ | ~~`agent-adapter-overloading`~~ | **abandoned** | — | Moved to Origami repo. |
| 6th | `workspace-catalog` | draft | **Defer** | Hard dep on workspace-mvp. Heaviest Go-code. Not PoC-blocking; MVP covers M12/M13. |

### Completed

|------|----------|--------|-------|
| ~~quick-win~~ | ~~`data-swipe`~~ | **complete** | Scrubbed. Moved to `completed/poc-v2/`. |
| ~~quick-win~~ | ~~`architecture-snapshots`~~ | **complete** | 11 diagrams across 4 files. Moved to `completed/knowledge-store/`. |
| ~~quick-win~~ | ~~`fsc-knowledge-compartmentalization`~~ | **complete** | 4 compartments, 3 alwaysApply. Moved to `completed/knowledge-store/`. |
| ~~vision~~ | ~~`soul-red-hat-telco`~~ | **complete** | Red Hat identity, telco mission, OSS philosophy. Moved to `completed/knowledge-store/`. |
| ~~SHOULD~~ | ~~`concurrent-subagents-determinism`~~ | **complete** | Moved to Origami repo `completed/poc-v2/`. |
| ~~SHOULD~~ | ~~`subagent-testing-framework`~~ | **complete** | Moved to Origami repo `completed/poc-v2/`. |

### NICE — Architecture evolution, post-PoC

| Tier | Contract | Status | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| **vision** | `workspace-revisited` | draft | Long-term workspace vision: layered composition, dependency graph, summarization. Trimmed to Phases 3-4. |
| **vision** | `domain-calibration` | draft | Scope calibration as per-domain. Asterisk RCA calibration (Origami extraction calibration moved to Origami repo). |

Framework contracts (Tomes I-IV, MCP, multi-subagent) moved to `github.com/dpopsuev/origami/.cursor/contracts/completed/`.

## Goal Transition Protocol

When this goal is met (rp-e2e-launch complete + tuning loop stop condition reached):

1. Archive this manifest in `notes/` as `goal-history-poc.md`
2. Create a new `current-goal.mdc` for the next goal (likely: MCP integration)
3. Reassess all draft contracts — re-tier relative to the new goal
4. Move completed contracts to `completed/` with appropriate phase subdirectory
