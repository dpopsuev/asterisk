# Current Goal

**Goal:** Polishing & Presentation  
**Summary:** The PoC proved Asterisk works. Now make it shine. Asterisk should be a lean, impressive sports car — when viewers see it, they think "Wow, Sundays and Mondays are now for real work." Origami is the engine reveal: a stable, polished API that opens a new world of agentic pipeline orchestration. Both repos must be presentation-ready.

## Vision

**Asterisk (the car):** Lean domain tool. Every line of code serves the RCA mission. No dead weight, no framework leakage, no rough edges. The CLI, the output, the calibration results — all must evoke confidence. "This thing just works."

**Origami (the engine):** Stable API surface. Clean documentation. The playground runs, the DSL is expressive, the concepts (Elements, Personas, Masks, Dialectic) are coherent and discoverable. When the hood opens, people find something they didn't know existed.

## PoC Results (proven)

| Adapter | Scenario | M19 | Key metrics | Notes |
|---------|----------|-----|-------------|-------|
| BasicAdapter | ptp-real-ingest (18 verified) | **0.83** | M1=1.00, M2=1.00, M15=0.72 | Heuristic baseline. 19/21 metrics pass. |
| CursorAdapter | ptp-real-ingest (18 verified) | **0.58** | M2=0.78, M8=0.60, M14b=0.30 | AI baseline. 10/21 pass. Root causes documented. |

## Asterisk — Urgency Map

| Tier | Contract | Status | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| **should** | `demo-presentation` | draft | Inside Out-themed PoC presentation. Police station theme, Kami debugger, recorded replay. Companion to Origami `kami-live-debugger`. |
| **should** | `knowledge-source-migration` | draft | Migrate 11 files from deprecated `origami/workspace` to `origami/knowledge`. Removes stale dependency. |
| **should** | `ground-truth-dataset` | draft | Ph1-2 done. Ph7: export to JSON + GitHub PR. Presentation-ready dataset. |
| **nice** | `evidence-gap-brief` | draft | Structured "I don't know" output. Polish for when confidence is low. |
| **vision** | `knowledge-source-evolution` | draft | Layered composition, `Source.Tags`, token-budget summarization. Long-term architecture. |

## Origami — Urgency Map

| Tier | Contract | Status | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| **should** | `kami-live-debugger` | draft | Kami live agentic debugger (Demiurge pattern). Presentation-critical. |
| **should** | `ouroboros-seed-pipeline` | draft | 3-node pipeline + YAML seeds + Persona Sheet. |
| **nice** | `consumer-ergonomics` | draft | ResolvePipelinePath, WithOutputCapture, DefaultWalker. API polish. |
| **nice** | `prompt-calibration` | draft | Framework-level prompt tuning loop. Per-step accuracy. Deferred. |
| **nice** | `domain-calibration` | draft | Per-domain calibration scoping (Asterisk, Origami, Achilles); `curate/eval/`. |

## What "presentation-ready" means

### Asterisk
- [ ] Zero stale imports (no `origami/workspace` references)
- [ ] Clean `go vet ./...`, `go build ./...`, `go test ./...`
- [ ] README tells the story: problem, solution, results (M19 numbers)
- [ ] `asterisk calibrate` demo runs cleanly with meaningful output
- [ ] Ground truth dataset is JSON (reviewable), not just Go structs

### Origami
- [ ] `examples/playground/` runs and demonstrates all concepts
- [ ] API surface is stable — no breaking changes pending
- [ ] `docs/framework-guide.md` is current and coherent
- [ ] Test coverage on public API is solid
- [ ] README positions Origami as a standalone framework

## Goal Transition Protocol

When presentation is delivered:

1. Archive this manifest in `notes/` as `goal-history-polish.md`
2. Create a new `current-goal.mdc` for the next goal
3. Reassess all draft contracts — re-tier relative to the new goal
