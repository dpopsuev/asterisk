# Current Goal

**Goal:** PoC completion  
**Reference:** `goals/poc.mdc`  
**Summary:** Prove Asterisk can do real blind RCA on RP data with both BasicAdapter (heuristic) and CursorAdapter (AI via MCP), push results back to ReportPortal, then tune accuracy through targeted quick wins.

## Urgency Map

Ordered by priority. Agents should work top-down: complete the gate before touching quick-wins; complete quick-wins before next-milestone.

| Tier | Contract | Status | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| **gate** | `rp-e2e-launch` | active | Final PoC gate. 20 RP-sourced cases (of 30 total), 18 verified ground truth. BasicAdapter phases complete (M19=0.83). CursorAdapter blind test via MCP in progress. Push gated on cursor adapter confidence. |
| **quick-win** | `poc-tuning-loop` | draft | Activates after rp-e2e-launch. Surface RP attributes, wire Jira links, tune keyword maps. Tight calibrate-measure-commit loop. |
| **quick-win** | `improve-human-operator-output` | draft | Agent narration: human words, progress, ETA, trajectory during calibration. Zero Go changes — agent rule update only. |
| **quick-win** | `evidence-gap-brief` | draft | Structured "what's missing" output when confidence is low. Feeds tuning loop priorities and Defect Court mistrial. |
| **gate** | `poc-scope-precision` | draft | Zero-friction packaging: simplified CLI, Cursor skill, CEO-ready README. Required for external demo. |
| **next-milestone** | `mcp-server-foundation` | draft | MCP chain step 1. `asterisk serve` over stdio; placeholder tools. Post-PoC. |
| **next-milestone** | `mcp-pipeline-tools` | draft | MCP chain step 2. F0-F6 pipeline tools. Depends on mcp-server-foundation. |
| **next-milestone** | `mcp-calibration-mode` | draft | MCP chain step 3. Calibration-specific MCP tools. Depends on mcp-pipeline-tools. |
| **next-milestone** | `origami-ground-truth-ingestor` | draft | Agentic dataset curation: AI subagents consume unstructured evidence into structured ground truth. JSON files, CLI-first, MCP bridge. |
| **vision** | `defect-court` | draft | Adversarial RCA (D0-D4). No timeline. |
| **vision** | `workspace-revisited` | draft | Universal artifact reference system. No timeline. |
| **vision** | _(persona-system)_ | not yet written | Specialized prompt preambles with workspace binding. No timeline. |

## Goal Transition Protocol

When this goal is met (rp-e2e-launch complete + tuning loop stop condition reached):

1. Archive this manifest in `notes/` as `goal-history-poc.md`
2. Create a new `current-goal.mdc` for the next goal (likely: MCP integration)
3. Reassess all draft contracts — re-tier relative to the new goal
4. Move completed contracts to `completed/` with appropriate phase subdirectory
