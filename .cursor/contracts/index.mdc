# .cursor/contracts Index

Work contracts -- session-independent execution plans with state, tasks, and completion criteria.

**Organization:** Directories reflect lifecycle status (`draft/`, `active/`, `completed/`). Urgency relative to the current goal is defined in `current-goal.mdc`. Read the goal manifest first to know what matters now.

## active/ -- Contracts being executed

| Contract | Goal | Serves |
|----------|------|--------|
| `cursor-prompt-tuning.md` | Improve CursorAdapter accuracy via prompt edits: taxonomy alignment, component priors. Iterative Phase 5a re-runs. | PoC completion (gate) |
| `rp-e2e-launch.md` | Real blind E2E run: fetch 4 RP-linked launches, analyze with BasicAdapter, score against Jira-verified ground truth, push at least 1 result back to RP. **Final PoC gate.** | PoC completion |
| `metacal-run-1.md` | Discover all Cursor auto-select models via prompt negation, run one behavioral probe on each, persist as first meta-calibration dataset. | Framework showcase (gate) |
| `mcp-underload-decouple.md` | Underload & decouple: framework-level MCP (Server, SignalBus, WatchStdin); Asterisk domain keeps session and tool handlers only. ROGYB per component. | Architecture evolution |

## draft/ -- Planned, not yet being executed

| Contract | Goal | Serves |
|----------|------|--------|
| `workspace-catalog.md` | Artifact catalog with fetch-through, format registry, CI log readers. Split from workspace-revisited. | PoC quality (SHOULD) |
| `poc-tuning-loop.md` | Improve BasicAdapter accuracy on blind cases via targeted prompt/pipeline improvements. Activates after rp-e2e-launch. | PoC completion |

| `origami-ground-truth-ingestor.md` | Agentic dataset curation: AI subagents consume unstructured evidence into structured ground truth. JSON files, CLI-first, MCP bridge. Target: 50+ verified cases + PR workflow. | Dataset growth |
| `improve-human-operator-output.md` | Agent narration during calibration: human words not machine codes, progress/ETA/trajectory, milestone summaries. | PoC completion |
| `defect-court.md` | Adversarial "Defect Court" phase (D0-D4). **Absorbed by `agentic-framework-III.3-shadow.md`.** | Architecture evolution |
| `workspace-revisited.md` | Long-term workspace vision: layered composition, dependency graph, summarization. Phases 3-4 (trimmed after MVP + Catalog splits). | Architecture evolution |
| `agent-adapter-overloading.md` | Multi-adapter orchestration. **Phase 1 absorbed by III.1-personae. Status: abandoned.** | Architecture evolution |
| `agentmux-decoupling.md` | Extract generic agent orchestration. **Absorbed by `agentic-framework-I.1-ontology.md`.** | Architecture evolution |
| `meta-calibration.md` | Task-based behavioral assessment of LLM models, producing empirical ModelProfiles that replace hardcoded persona traits. | Architecture evolution |
| `domain-calibration.md` | Explicitly scope calibration as per-domain; establish Origami's domain calibration alongside Asterisk's. | Architecture evolution |
| `metacal-mcp-server.md` | MCP server for meta-calibration discovery loop (`metacal serve`); Cursor drives negation iterations end-to-end. | Architecture evolution |
