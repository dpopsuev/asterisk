# .cursor/contracts Index

Work contracts -- session-independent execution plans with state, tasks, and completion criteria.

**Organization:** Directories reflect lifecycle status (`draft/`, `active/`, `completed/`). Urgency relative to the current goal is defined in `current-goal.mdc`. Read the goal manifest first to know what matters now.
