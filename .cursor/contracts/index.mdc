# .cursor/contracts Index

Work contracts -- session-independent execution plans with state, tasks, and completion criteria.

**Organization:** Directories reflect lifecycle status (`draft/`, `active/`, `completed/`). Urgency relative to the current goal is defined in `current-goal.mdc`. Read the goal manifest first to know what matters now.

## active/ -- Contracts being executed

| Contract | Goal | Serves |
|----------|------|--------|
| `asterisk-calibrate-skill.md` | Ship an `asterisk-calibrate` Cursor Skill that drives wet LLM calibration via MCP — zero file writes, zero approval gates. | PoC completion (gate) |
| `domain-cursor-prompt-tuning.md` | Improve CursorAdapter accuracy via prompt edits: taxonomy alignment, component priors. Iterative Phase 5a re-runs. **(Domain)** | PoC completion (gate) |
| `rp-e2e-launch.md` | Real blind E2E run: fetch 4 RP-linked launches, analyze with BasicAdapter, score against Jira-verified ground truth, push at least 1 result back to RP. **Final PoC gate.** | PoC completion |
| `wet-calibration-tuning.md` | Lift CursorAdapter ptp-mock dry M19 from 0.49 to >= 0.65. **Complete** (M19=0.74). Terminology corrected: runs were dry, not wet. | PoC completion (gate) |
| `m3-m9-tuning.md` | Lift M3 (Recall Hit Rate) from 0.33 to >= 0.70 and M9 (Repo Selection Precision) from 0.62 to >= 0.70. | PoC completion (gate) |
| `efficiency-m16-m17-m18-tuning.md` | Lift M16 (Path Accuracy) >= 0.60, M17 (Loop Efficiency) into 0.5–2.0, M18 (Tokens) <= 60000. Depends on M3 fix. | PoC completion (gate) |

## draft/ -- Planned, not yet being executed

| Contract | Goal | Serves |
|----------|------|--------|
| `workspace-catalog.md` | Artifact catalog with fetch-through, format registry, CI log readers. Split from workspace-revisited. | PoC quality (SHOULD) |
| `poc-tuning-loop.md` | Improve BasicAdapter accuracy on blind cases via targeted prompt/pipeline improvements. Activates after rp-e2e-launch. | PoC completion |
| `evidence-gap-brief.md` | Structured "what's missing" output when pipeline confidence is low or inconclusive. Shared `EvidenceGap` type with Defect Dialectic unresolved contradiction. | PoC completion |
| `origami-ground-truth-ingestor.md` | Agentic dataset curation: AI subagents consume unstructured evidence into structured ground truth. JSON files, CLI-first, MCP bridge. Target: 50+ verified cases + PR workflow. | Dataset growth |
| `workspace-revisited.md` | Long-term workspace vision: layered composition, dependency graph, summarization. Phases 3-4 (trimmed after MVP + Catalog splits). | Architecture evolution |
| `domain-calibration.md` | Explicitly scope calibration as per-domain; establish Origami's domain calibration alongside Asterisk's. | Architecture evolution |
