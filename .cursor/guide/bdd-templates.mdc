# BDD Templates

## Data ingestion
Given a Report Portal launch exists with failed tests  
When Asterik ingests the launch  
Then failures are listed with suite, labels, environment, timestamps, and artifacts

## Repository mapping
Given a failure includes component labels or file paths  
When Asterik resolves repository mappings  
Then mapped repos are listed with rule evidence and confidence

## Commit correlation
Given a failure timestamp and mapped repositories  
When Asterik queries commit history for the time window  
Then candidate commits are listed with diffs and authors

## Cross-run correlation
Given the same test appears in multiple launches  
When Asterik aggregates failures across runs  
Then flake rate and recurrence are calculated

## Classification + actions
Given evidence from logs, commits, and pipeline context  
When Asterik classifies the failure  
Then a category and confidence are shown with recommended actions

## Export
Given an RCA summary is generated  
When the user requests export  
Then a Report Portal comment and/or GitHub issue is created
