# Pre-Implementation Development Flow

Use this flow before laying down code foundations.

## Full flow
1. Problem framing (context, pain points, impacted users)
2. Goal statement (measurable success + non-goals)
3. Constraints and assumptions (data access, security, scale, dependencies)
4. Personas and user research (who uses it, current workflows)
5. User stories and acceptance criteria (BDD-ready)
6. Solution framing (options, trade-offs, rationale)
7. Architecture (boundaries, data flows, trust zones)
8. Components and interfaces (responsibilities, contracts)
9. Tech stack and integrations (choices and reasons)
10. Implementation plan (phases, risks, test plan, rollout)

## Fast path (MVP)
Goal statement -> Constraints -> User stories -> Architecture -> MVP plan
