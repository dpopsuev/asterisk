# TDD Test Matrix

For every story, implement:
- Unit: parsing, mapping, scoring, and classifiers
- Integration: Report Portal API, GitHub/Git providers, Jenkins/Prow
- Contract: API schemas, auth scopes, rate limits
- E2E: full pipeline from RP launch to RCA output
- Security: secret redaction, RBAC scope, audit logging
