# TDD Test Matrix

**Moved to an always-applied rule:** The full pre-code-write coverage checklist, including the Red-Orange-Green-Blue cycle and security layer, now lives at `rules/test-coverage-checklist.mdc`.

This file remains as a pointer for existing cross-references.

## Quick summary

For every story, assess coverage across:
- **Unit** — parsing, mapping, scoring, classifiers, edge cases
- **Integration** — RP API, Git/GitHub, CI adapters, store, dispatcher
- **Contract** — API schemas, auth scopes, rate limits
- **E2E** — full F0-F6 pipeline, stub + real calibration
- **Concurrency** — race detector, deadlock-free channels, semaphore bounds
- **Security** — OWASP Top 10 lens (`rules/security-analysis.mdc`)

See `rules/test-coverage-checklist.mdc` for the full gate and development cycle.
