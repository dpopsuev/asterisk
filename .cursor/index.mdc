# .cursor Index

Purpose: quick map for agentic AI to locate guidance without re-scanning repos.

## Directories
- `rules/` — always-on AI behavior and development style constraints.
- `guide/` — software development process and workflow guidance.
- `docs/` — deep library (long-form references).
- `notes/` — short summaries and quick references.
- `contracts/` — work contracts by lifecycle status; urgency via goal manifest:
  - `draft/` — planned contracts not yet being executed.
  - `active/` — contracts currently being executed.
  - `completed/` — finished contracts grouped by original development phase.
  - `current-goal.mdc` — goal manifest: declares active goal and urgency map.
- `security-cases/` — security bug post-mortems (RCA, severity, mitigation).
- `prompts/` — RCA prompt templates (dev); later moved to CLI prompt directory.
- `strategy/` — long-term objectives and invariants.
- `tactics/` — situational playbooks ("if X, do Y").
- `taxonomy/` — naming and classification rules.
- `glossary/` — domain terms and definitions.
- `goals/` — goal checklist + per-goal details.
- `skills/` — project-specific skill definitions.

## Files
- `meta.mdc` — portable meta-engineering rules for .cursor structure.
- `kombucha.mdc` — portable FSC seed; copy repo-to-repo to bootstrap .cursor.
- `mcp.json` — MCP server configuration (e.g. Ouroboros, report-portal); used by Cursor to load tools.
