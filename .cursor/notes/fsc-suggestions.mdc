# FSC Suggestions (backlog)

**Already in FSC:** Execution Envelope (`docs/execution-envelope.mdc`), context workspace (`docs/context-workspace.mdc`), CLI data model (`docs/cli-data-model.mdc`), prompts (`docs/prompts.mdc`).

**Open (add when needed):**
- Architecture overview (core + RP adapter + context sources).
- RCA decision rubric (inputs, outputs, confidence rules).
- Adapter contracts (RP, GitHub, future GitLab).
- Evidence schema (what counts as evidence, how cited).

Store in `docs/` (reference) or `strategy/` (invariants) or `tactics/` (playbooks).
