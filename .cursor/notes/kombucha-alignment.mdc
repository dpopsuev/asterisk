description: Alignment between Asterik FSC and Kombucha compiler spec

# Kombucha Alignment

Asterik FSC is aligned with the artifacts emitted by `.cursor/kombucha.mdc` (FSC compiler). Intentional differences are documented here.

## Implemented (Kombucha-aligned)

- **contracts/** — Work contracts with `_TEMPLATE.md`; session-independent execution plans. Rule: `.cursor/rules/knowledge-store.mdc`.
- **security-cases/** — Security post-mortems with `_TEMPLATE.md`; naming `SEC-{NNN}-{slug}.md`. Rule: `.cursor/rules/security-analysis.mdc`.
- **rules/** — Added `knowledge-store.mdc`, `security-analysis.mdc`.
- **skills/index-integrity** — Scan and enforce `index.mdc` compliance; reconcile filesystem vs indexes.
- **meta.mdc** — Directory purposes include `contracts/`, `security-cases/`; expected skills include `index-integrity`.

## Intentional differences

| Kombucha | Asterik | Reason |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `.index.mdc` (hidden) | `index.mdc` | Asterik uses visible `index.mdc` in every directory; index-integrity skill uses `index.mdc`. |
| Test matrix in `rules/` | Test matrix in `guide/test-matrix.mdc` | Already in guide; kept for consistency with dev-flow and BDD. |
| `guide/dev-flow.mdc` | `guide/dev-flow.md` | Asterik uses `.md` for dev-flow; same content. |
| No goals/glossary/strategy/tactics/taxonomy | goals/, glossary/, strategy/, tactics/, taxonomy/ | Asterik extensions for product goals, domain terms, and playbooks; preserved. |

## Save triggers

`rules/knowledge-store.mdc` includes Asterik-specific targets: `goals/`, `glossary/` in addition to docs, notes, contracts, security-cases, rules.

## Bootstrap skill

Asterik bootstrap (`.cursor/skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md`) should create `contracts/` and `security-cases/` when missing and create their `index.mdc`; never overwrite. Index-integrity is used to reconcile existing indexes.
