# Roadmap Summary

Product roadmap (distinct from the operational three phases in `three-phases-manual.mdc`).

## Phase 0 — Foundations
- Ingest Report Portal failures for a run.
- Map failures to relevant code repositories.

## Phase 1 — Evidence Gathering
- Pull commit history and diffs around the failure window.
- Pull CI pipeline context (stages, artifacts, env vars).

## Phase 2 — Correlation & Attribution
- Correlate failures across runs (multi-run history).
- Link failures to suspected code paths or manifests.

## Phase 3 — Triage Intelligence
- Assign probable root cause category with confidence.
- Suggest next diagnostic actions.

## Phase 4 — Reporting & Feedback
- Export RCA summaries back into Report Portal / GitHub issues.
- Learn from confirmed RCA outcomes.

## Phase 5 — Optional / Advanced
- Detect flaky tests via historical patterns.
- Correlate with cluster metrics/events.
- Explain RCA in natural language with citations.
