# Contract Iteration

Active and goal-mapped contracts are living documents. They accumulate insights not just during explicit execution sessions, but from any discussion, calibration run, or field observation that touches their domain.

## Scope

Read `contracts/current-goal.mdc` to determine which contracts are in scope. Monitored tiers:

- **gate** — always monitored
- **quick-win** — always monitored
- **next-milestone** — monitored for architectural insights and assumption validation

**vision** tier is excluded from active monitoring. Vision contracts receive insights only when explicitly discussed.

## Behaviors

### After calibration or E2E runs

When a calibration or E2E run produces results:

1. Check per-case results for misclassification patterns, unexpected scores, or anomalies.
2. If a pattern maps to a candidate quick win or active contract task: propose logging it in that contract's Notes section with a timestamp.
3. If a new quick-win opportunity is discovered: propose adding it as a candidate in the relevant contract.

### During discussions

When a conversation touches a topic relevant to a monitored contract:

1. Propose adding the insight to the contract's Notes section (format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — insight`).
2. If the insight is a concrete improvement idea: propose promoting it to a task in the contract.
3. If the insight contradicts an assumption in a draft contract: flag it explicitly.

### Cross-contract feedback

When an active contract's results or findings affect a draft contract:

1. Log the finding in the draft contract's Notes.
2. If the finding invalidates part of the draft's approach: flag for reassessment.
3. If the finding strengthens the draft's approach: note it as supporting evidence.

## Goal manifest as routing table

The urgency map in `contracts/current-goal.mdc` serves as the routing table. When deciding which contract an insight belongs to:

1. Read the urgency map to identify relevant contracts by tier.
2. Match the insight's domain to the contract's Goal and Context.
3. Prefer the highest-urgency matching contract (gate > quick-win > next-milestone).
4. If no existing contract matches: propose creating a new contract or adding the insight to a note.

## Contract lifecycle transitions

When monitoring reveals that a draft contract should become active:

1. Verify all dependencies (listed in the contract) are met.
2. Verify the gate contract is complete (or the goal manifest permits parallel work).
3. Propose moving the contract: `git mv contracts/draft/{slug}.md contracts/active/`
4. Update the contract's `Status:` field to `active`.
5. Update `contracts/current-goal.mdc` to reflect the new status.
