description: Prevent re-introduction of scrubbed internal hostnames
---

# Data Hygiene

Internal infrastructure hostnames were scrubbed from the entire git history. They must never be reintroduced.

## Prohibited content

The following categories of internal identifiers must not appear in committed files:

| Category | Example placeholder (what should appear) |
|---|---|
| RP instance hostname | `your-reportportal.example.com` |
| S3/Minio hostname | `your-minio-s3.example.com` |
| Jenkins CI hostname | `your-jenkins.example.com` |
| Lab registry hostname | `registry.hub-cluster.example.com` |
| Lab cluster identifiers | `spoke-cluster`, `hub-cluster` |
| CI notification email | `ci-notify@example.com` |
| Internal domain globs | `*.apps.your-ocp-cluster.example.com` |

## Agent behavior

- **Before committing:** verify no internal hostname patterns appear in staged files. Use `.dev/verify-swipe.sh` if the pattern file is available.
- **When writing examples, docs, or config** that reference infrastructure: use the placeholder values from the table above.
- **When fetching data from RP or CI at runtime:** the data stays in `.dev/` (gitignored) or other untracked locations. Never commit raw API responses containing real hostnames.
- **If a real hostname is needed in code:** parameterize it via environment variable, CLI flag, or config file (gitignored).

## Verification

The `.dev/verify-swipe.sh` script checks all tracked files against the pattern file. Run it before any commit that touches documentation, examples, or configuration.

## Pre-commit hook

A Git pre-commit hook (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`) automatically blocks commits that contain scrubbed patterns. It reads from `.dev/data-swipe-patterns.txt` and checks staged files.
