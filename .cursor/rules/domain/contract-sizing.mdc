# Contract Sizing

## When to apply

Apply this rule when creating a new contract or reviewing an existing contract that has grown beyond its original scope.

## Goal alignment check

Before creating or approving a contract, verify:

1. **Current goal alignment**: Does this contract serve the active goal in `contracts/current-goal.mdc`? If yes, what urgency tier (gate, quick-win)?
2. **Next-line goal alignment**: Does this contract serve the next milestone? If yes, mark it as next-milestone in the urgency map.
3. **Neither**: If the contract serves neither the current nor next goal, classify as vision tier. Vision contracts are design documents, not execution plans.

## Size thresholds

A contract that exceeds any of these thresholds should be split:

| Indicator | Threshold | Action |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Task count | > 15 tasks | Split into must/should/nice sub-contracts |
| Phase count | > 3 phases | Each phase becomes a separate contract |
| Estimated duration | > 2 sprints (person working alone) | Split by deliverable boundary |
| Mixed urgency | Tasks span must AND nice categories | Split by urgency tier |

## Urgency classification

When splitting, classify each sub-contract:

| Tier | Definition | PoC relevance |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| **MUST** | Blocks the current PoC gate or pitch demo. Without this, the PoC cannot be demonstrated. | Score-blocking metrics (M2=0.00, M12/M13=0.00), missing data circuits |
| **SHOULD** | Significantly improves PoC quality or pitch polish. The PoC works without it but is weaker. | Testing infrastructure, dataset growth, identity/branding |
| **NICE** | Architecture evolution, post-PoC vision. Valuable but not blocking anything near-term. | Full artifact catalogs, learned routing, adversarial review |

## Split naming convention

When a parent contract is split, the sub-contracts reference the parent:

```
parent-contract.md       → retained as the "nice" vision (trimmed)
parent-mvp.md            → must-have split
parent-catalog.md        → should-have split (named by deliverable)
```

Each sub-contract includes a "Split from" note in its context section linking back to the parent.

## Contract size audit trigger

Re-evaluate contract sizing when:

- A new goal is set in `current-goal.mdc`
- A calibration run reveals new blockers (metrics at 0.00)
- A contract accumulates more than 5 new tasks from contract-iteration feedback
- A contract has been in draft for more than 2 goal cycles without activation
