# FSC Structure Rules

## FSC definition
- **FSC (File-System Context)** refers to the `.cursor/` knowledge store.
- `.cursor/meta.mdc` is the binding structure contract.
- Verify Cursor structures (skills/rules/commands) against official Cursor docs.

## Directories
- `.cursor/index.mdc` is the entry map for agentic context and must be current.
- `.cursor/docs/` — deep library references.
- `.cursor/notes/` — short summaries and quick references.
- `.cursor/guide/` — software development process guidance.
- `.cursor/contracts/` — work contracts (execution plans with state, tasks, completion criteria).
- `.cursor/security-cases/` — security bug post-mortems (RCA, severity, mitigation).
- `.cursor/prompts/` — RCA prompt templates (file-based; dev location; see docs/prompts.mdc).
- `.cursor/strategy/` — long-term objectives and invariants.
- `.cursor/tactics/` — situational playbooks ("if X, do Y").
- `.cursor/taxonomy/` — naming and classification rules.
- `.cursor/glossary/` — domain terms and meanings.
- `.cursor/goals/` — goal checklist + per-goal details.
- `.cursor/skills/` — project-specific skill definitions.

## Skills
- Skills live at `.cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
- `name` in `SKILL.md` must match the folder name.

## File extensions
- Use `.mdc` for Cursor rules or when frontmatter metadata is required.
- Use `.md` for general notes and documents.

## Index integrity
- `index.mdc` files must be shallow: list only direct children.
- Always update the local `index.mdc` on add/remove/rename.
- Index integrity is mandatory; directory changes without index updates are incomplete.

## Topic block trigger
- For each delimited topic, propose **"Save Block {{ID}}"** with target directories + reasons.
- On trigger, add the block to the proposed directories.
