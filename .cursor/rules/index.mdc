# .cursor/rules Index

## Files
- `index.mdc` — index for this directory.
- `go-testing.mdc` — Go testing preferences: default = standard library `testing`; when to consider a framework (testify, ginkgo); naming (TestXxx), helpers (t.Helper()), fixtures. See `contracts/go-testing-preferences.md`.
- `workspace-context.mdc` — prefer Cursor workspace + git clone all relevant repos (increases agent speed); workspace includes all relevant code and docs; always reference them when needed; version alignment (e.g. service-api 5.11.x).
- `scenario-vs-generic.mdc` — always ask: is this scenario-specific or generic? Separate pure model from current use case; document scenario-specific layout/labels as use-case sections.
- `asterisk-development.mdc` — core development style for Asterisk (evidence-first RCA, BDD/TDD, security, PoC focus).
- `fsc-structure.mdc` — FSC structure rules and Cursor conventions.
- `work-contracts.mdc` — when to create work contracts; template and commit convention.
- `security-analysis.mdc` — OWASP-aligned security lens for features and code changes.
- `save-triggers.mdc` — persistence protocol (Save Block → docs/notes/contracts/rules/etc.).
- `impatient-agent.mdc` — abort blocking operations early (30s own code, 60s external); design with timeouts and progress signals; diagnose and optimize after every abort.
- `test-coverage-checklist.mdc` — pre-code-write coverage gate (unit, integration, contract, e2e, concurrency, security); Red-Orange-Green-Blue cycle (Orange = agent log instrumentation).
