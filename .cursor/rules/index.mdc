# .cursor/rules Index

Rules are organized into **compartments** reflecting their scope and trust model. See `rules/domain/knowledge-store.mdc` for the full compartment model.

## Root-level

| Rule | Routing | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `rule-router.mdc` | **alwaysApply** | Magic-word lookup table mapping user intent to the correct rule file. |

## universal/ — Generic IT Engineering (committed, shared)

Rules portable across any software project. Most are `globs`-scoped to relevant file types.

| Rule | Routing | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `testing-methodology.mdc` | `globs: **/*.go` | Coverage matrix, ROGYB cycle, BDD/Gherkin (Given/When/Then), security-as-test. |
| `security-analysis.mdc` | agent-requestable | OWASP Top 10 checklist for features and trust-boundary changes. |
| `abstraction-boundaries.mdc` | `globs: **/*.go` | Separate generic domain models from scenario-specific implementations. |
| `reviewability-first.mdc` | agent-requestable | Prefer observable, git-diffable formats over opaque binary stores. |
| `off-the-shelf.mdc` | `globs: **/*.go` | Prefer mature modules; maturity gate and decision matrix. |
| `go-test-conventions.mdc` | `globs: **/*.go` | Go test framework (Ginkgo + stdlib hybrid), naming, fixtures. |
| `papert-paradigm.mdc` | `globs: pkg/framework/**` | Low floor / high ceiling / wide walls — design checklist for framework components. |

## domain/ — Asterisk Project (committed, shared)

Rules specific to this repository and its domain.

| Rule | Routing | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `project-standards.mdc` | **alwaysApply** | Product definition, methodology (ROGYB, Gherkin acceptance criteria), calibration ordering, data handling, output. |
| `agent-operations.mdc` | **alwaysApply** | Local pipeline stages, timeout SLAs, abort protocol, observability. |
| `knowledge-store.mdc` | **alwaysApply** | `.cursor/` structure, index integrity, persistence protocol, work contracts. |
| `contract-iteration.mdc` | `globs: .cursor/contracts/**` | Monitor contracts for insights from discussions and calibration runs. |
| `architecture-snapshots.mdc` | `globs: .cursor/**/*.md` | Architecture diagrams as first-class artifacts; current/desired state snapshots. |
| `data-hygiene.mdc` | `globs: .cursor/**` | Prevent re-introduction of scrubbed internal hostnames; placeholder values. |
| `workspace-context.mdc` | agent-requestable | Local repos as source of truth; version alignment (RP 5.11.x). |
| `human-readable-output.mdc` | agent-requestable | Codes for machines, words for humans; `internal/display` registry. |
| `contract-sizing.mdc` | `globs: .cursor/contracts/**` | Contract sizing and urgency classification; goal alignment check; must/should/nice splits. |

## Gitignored compartments

Two additional compartments live under `.cursor/` but are gitignored:

- **`personal/`** — Per-developer preferences, private notes, agent personality tuning. See `personal/README.md`.
- **`sensitive/`** — Internal hostnames, infrastructure details, credentials. See `sensitive/README.md`.
