# .cursor/rules Index

## Files

- `index.mdc` — this index.
- `project-standards.mdc` — product definition, development methodology, calibration ordering, data handling, and output requirements.
- `agent-operations.mdc` — agent execution model: local CI/CD pipeline stages, timeout SLAs, abort protocol, observability requirements, and anti-patterns.
- `testing-methodology.mdc` — coverage matrix (unit/integration/contract/e2e/concurrency/security), Red-Orange-Green-Yellow-Blue development cycle, and security-as-test.
- `go-test-conventions.mdc` — Go test framework selection (Ginkgo + stdlib hybrid), naming conventions, fixtures, and dependency management. File-scoped to `**/*.go`.
- `abstraction-boundaries.mdc` — separate generic domain models from scenario-specific implementations; adapter pattern over hardcoded layouts.
- `security-analysis.mdc` — OWASP Top 10 checklist applied to every feature and trust-boundary change; security case filing protocol.
- `workspace-context.mdc` — local-first workspace: cloned repos as source of truth, version alignment (RP 5.11.x), read from disk instead of guessing.
- `human-readable-output.mdc` — "Code for machines, words for humans": machine codes stay in machine contexts; human-facing output uses readable names via `internal/display` registry.
- `knowledge-store.mdc` — `.cursor/` directory structure, index integrity protocol, persistence triggers, and work contract conventions (status-based directories, goal manifest).
- `contract-iteration.mdc` — monitor active and goal-mapped contracts for insights from discussions, field results, and calibration runs; cross-contract feedback; lifecycle transitions.
- `off-the-shelf.mdc` — prefer mature, community-backed Go modules over bespoke implementations when justified; maturity gate and decision matrix. File-scoped to `**/*.go`.
- `agent-bus.mdc` — mandatory signaling protocol for agent/subagent coordination during MCP calibration; delegation mandate, signal events, and observability alignment.
- `reviewability-first.mdc` — prefer observable, git-diffable formats over opaque binary stores; the self-reinforcement loop (mutate → review → feedback → improve) requires every agent mutation to be visible in PR diffs.
- `data-hygiene.mdc` — prevent re-introduction of scrubbed internal hostnames; prohibited content categories, placeholder values, verification protocol, pre-commit hook.
