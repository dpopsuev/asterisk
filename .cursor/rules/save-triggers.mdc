# Save Triggers

When a conversation produces **reusable knowledge**, propose persisting it to the FSC.

| Target | When |
|--------|------|
| `docs/` | Deep reference, long-form analysis |
| `notes/` | Short summary, quick reference |
| `contracts/` | Execution plan with tasks and state |
| `security-cases/` | Security bug found or suspected |
| `rules/` | New constraint, convention, or invariant |
| `goals/` | In-scope / out-of-scope notes |
| `glossary/` | New terms |

User says **"Save Block {{ID}}"** → persist to the appropriate target and update the parent `index.mdc`.
