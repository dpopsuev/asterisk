# Security Analysis

Evaluate every feature, endpoint, data flow, and trust boundary against the OWASP Top 10 before shipping.

## Checklist

| Category | Focus areas |
|----------|-------------|
| A01 Broken Access Control | Authorization checks, path traversal, IDOR, privilege escalation |
| A02 Cryptographic Failures | Encryption at rest and in transit, weak algorithms, key management |
| A03 Injection | SQL, command, template, LDAP — validate and parameterize all inputs |
| A04 Insecure Design | Threat modeling, safe defaults, fail-secure behavior |
| A05 Security Misconfiguration | Hardening, unused features, verbose error exposure |
| A06 Vulnerable Components | Dependency audit, known CVEs, update policy |
| A07 Authentication Failures | Session management, credential handling, MFA, rate limiting |
| A08 Data Integrity | Unsigned data, deserialization risks, CI/CD integrity |
| A09 Logging and Monitoring | Audit logs, alerting, incident response coverage |
| A10 SSRF | Outbound request validation, URL allowlists |

## Agent behavior

- On any change touching a trust boundary or handling external data, scan this checklist and flag findings.
- File a security case (`.cursor/security-cases/SEC-{NNN}-{slug}.md`) when a vulnerability or risk is identified.
- Severity classification: critical / high / medium / low / informational (CVSS-aligned).
