# Security Analysis

Security is a continuous lens. Evaluate every feature, endpoint, data flow, and trust boundary against **OWASP Top 10** before shipping.

## OWASP Top 10 — what to check

| Category | Focus |
|----------|--------|
| A01 Broken Access Control | Authz checks, path traversal, IDOR, privilege escalation. |
| A02 Cryptographic Failures | Encryption at rest/transit, weak algorithms, key management. |
| A03 Injection | SQL, command, template, LDAP — validate and parameterize. |
| A04 Insecure Design | Threat modeling, safe defaults, fail secure. |
| A05 Security Misconfiguration | Hardening, unused features, verbose errors. |
| A06 Vulnerable Components | Dependencies, known CVEs, update policy. |
| A07 Auth Failures | Session, credential handling, MFA, rate limiting. |
| A08 Data Integrity | Unsigned data, deserialization, CI/CD integrity. |
| A09 Logging/Monitoring | Audit logs, alerting, response to incidents. |
| A10 SSRF | Outbound requests, URL validation, allowlists. |

## Agent behavior

- On trust-boundary-touching or security-relevant code changes, scan this checklist; flag findings.
- File a security case (`.cursor/security-cases/SEC-{NNN}-{slug}.md`) when a bug or risk is found.
- Severity: critical / high / medium / low / informational (CVSS-aligned).

## Cross-reference

- Security layer in `.cursor/guide/test-matrix.mdc`.
- Security case template: `.cursor/security-cases/_TEMPLATE.md`.
