# Work Contracts

Contracts are **session-independent execution plans** with state (status, tasks, notes). Any agent can pick up a contract and continue from where the last one left off.

## When to create a contract

- A body of work spans multiple sessions or has a clear binary goal.
- You need a handoff protocol (tasks, acceptance criteria, notes with timestamps).

## Contract location and template

- **Directory:** `.cursor/contracts/`
- **Template:** Copy `.cursor/contracts/_TEMPLATE.md` to create a new contract (e.g. `my-feature.md`). Never edit the template.
- **Commit convention:** Each commit references the contract: `Contract: {slug} {step}/{total}`. Test suite must be green before every commit.

## Contract structure (from template)

Status, Goal, Contract rules, Context, Execution strategy, Tasks (always end with Validate → Tune → Validate), Acceptance criteria, Notes (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`).

## Index

After adding or removing a contract, update `.cursor/contracts/index.mdc`.
