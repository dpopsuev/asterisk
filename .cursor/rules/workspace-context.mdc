# Workspace Context

## Local-first principle

All relevant repositories are cloned into the Cursor workspace. This provides:

- **Zero-latency code access** — no network or API calls to read source.
- **Full-text search** across all repos (grep, semantic search, cross-reference).
- **Consistent version pinning** — research and implementation always match.
- **No external service dependency** — no rate limits, no downtime.

The workspace is the single source of truth. Read from disk; do not guess.

## Scope

The workspace (e.g., `asterisk.code-workspace`) includes all code and documentation for Asterisk development and RP API research. Repos and paths are listed in `notes/cursor-workspace-structure.mdc` with metadata (purpose, locked version).

## Agent behavior

- **Always reference workspace content** when answering questions about structure, endpoints, or behavior.
- When implementing or researching (RP API, CLI patterns, Execution Envelope): use workspace folders as the source of truth for the locked version (RP 5.11 / 24.1).
- Prefer reading from the workspace over relying on prior knowledge.

## Version alignment

- `report-portal/service-api` must be checked out at **5.11.x** so research matches the locked version. See `contracts/rp-api-research.md` and `notes/poc-constraints.mdc`.
