# RCA Strategy Invariants

- Ground every conclusion in evidence (logs, commits, pipeline data).
- Provide confidence scores with rationale.
- Prefer explainable heuristics before opaque model output.
- Track feedback on RCA correctness for continuous improvement.
- Keep outputs deterministic for the same inputs (seed ordering).
- Defect type classification must use AI models and structured prompts (no hard-coded parsing rules).
- Use a **convergence check** (and convergence score) to gate analysis rounds: deepen, try next Context Source, or stop.
