# RCA Strategy Invariants

## Quality invariants

- Ground every conclusion in evidence (logs, commits, pipeline data).
- Provide confidence scores with rationale.
- Prefer explainable heuristics before opaque model output.
- Track feedback on RCA correctness for continuous improvement.
- Keep outputs deterministic for the same inputs (seed ordering).
- Defect type classification must use AI models and structured prompts (no hard-coded parsing rules).
- Use a **convergence check** (and convergence score) to gate analysis rounds: deepen, try next Context Source, or stop.

## Company-aligned invariants

These invariants encode Red Hat's identity and operating model into Asterisk's design. See `strategy/red-hat-telco-soul.mdc` for the full context.

- **Upstream-first**: prefer open standards and open source tools over proprietary solutions. When Asterisk improves a pattern that benefits ReportPortal or other upstream projects, contribute it back.
- **Multi-operator**: design for N operators, not just PTP. Data models, prompts, and pipeline steps must work across any OpenShift operator (RAN, Core, edge, platform). Operator-specific logic belongs in adapters or configuration, not in the core.
- **Multi-CI**: design for N CI systems, not just Jenkins. CI-specific artifact paths, job structures, and notification formats belong in per-CI adapters. The core pipeline consumes abstract execution envelopes.
- **Community-ready**: outputs must be shareable, reproducible, and understandable by anyone in the telco QE community. Avoid jargon that assumes one team's context. An RCA should make sense to an engineer on a different operator team.
- **Evidence transparency**: align with Red Hat's open development model. No black-box conclusions. Every assertion must be traceable to a specific log line, commit, Jira ticket, or pipeline artifact. When traceability is impossible, state it explicitly.
