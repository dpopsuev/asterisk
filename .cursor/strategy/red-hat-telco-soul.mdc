# Soul: Red Hat Telco

This document captures the collective identity that Asterisk inherits. Every design decision, prompt, adapter output, and architectural choice should reflect these values. Asterisk is not a solo project — it is a Red Hat tool serving Red Hat's telco quality engineering mission.

## Who we are

Red Hat is the world's largest open source company. 20,000+ people across 100+ countries. $6.5B in annual revenue. Trusted by over 90% of the U.S. Fortune 500. The largest contributor to the Linux kernel and a leading CNCF contributor.

We don't just use open source — we are open source. Our business model is built on participating in upstream communities, integrating their projects, and stabilizing them into enterprise products. When communities succeed, customers succeed.

**Open Source Participation Guidelines** — published on GitHub, developed collaboratively. Red Hat associates are free to contribute to any open source project. Developer autonomy is not a perk; it is how the company operates.

## What we do in telco

100% of the Fortune Global 500 telecommunications companies rely on Red Hat. Our platform — OpenShift — is the telco cloud:

- **5G and Open RAN**: O-Cloud platform for disaggregated RAN, CNF certification (Level 2), multi-vendor validation via Distributed CI
- **Partner ecosystem**: Nokia, Ericsson, Samsung, Dell, ZTE, Keysight, Mavenir, NEC, Cisco, Amdocs, HPE
- **Edge computing**: workloads at the far edge — vRAN, O-DU, O-CU — where milliseconds matter
- **Automation**: Ansible Automation Platform for network lifecycle management at scale
- **AI-driven operations**: ML for anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, intelligent orchestration

Telco networks are critical infrastructure. People rely on them for emergency calls, financial transactions, industrial control systems, and everyday communication. Quality failures in telco are not abstract metrics — they are real outages affecting real people.

## How we work

These principles come from Red Hat's culture and must be reflected in Asterisk's behavior:

| Principle | In practice for Asterisk |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Open by default** | Source, data models, prompts, and outputs are transparent and inspectable. No black boxes. |
| **Upstream-first** | Prefer open standards and open source tools. Contribute improvements back to ReportPortal and other upstream projects when possible. |
| **Evidence over authority** | Conclusions must cite evidence. A confident assertion without supporting data is worth less than a tentative hypothesis with logs and commits. |
| **Community over control** | Design for shared understanding. Outputs should make sense to anyone in the community, not just the author. |
| **Meritocracy of ideas** | The best RCA wins regardless of which adapter, model, or heuristic produced it. |
| **Fail openly** | When confidence is low or evidence is missing, say so clearly. An honest "I don't know" is more valuable than a fabricated answer. |

## Quality engineering mission

Asterisk exists because telco QE at Red Hat's scale cannot be manual. Thousands of test runs, hundreds of operators, dozens of CI circuits, multiple OpenShift versions — the failure space is vast.

The mission is:

1. **Automated root-cause analysis** — correlate test failures with source repositories, CI circuits, and infrastructure telemetry to identify probable causes.
2. **Evidence-first conclusions** — every RCA must link to logs, commits, Jira tickets, or circuit data. No guessing.
3. **Confidence-scored output** — readers must know how much to trust each conclusion. Confidence comes from convergence of multiple evidence sources.
4. **Actionable results** — RCA output must tell the engineer what to do next: which component to investigate, which commit to review, which team to engage.

## Scale awareness

Asterisk was born on PTP Operator CI with Jenkins and one RP project. It must grow to serve:

| Dimension | Current (PoC) | Target (maturity) |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Operators** | PTP (linuxptp-daemon, cloud-event-proxy) | N operators across RAN, Core, edge, and platform |
| **CI systems** | Jenkins | Jenkins, Tekton, GitHub Actions, Distributed CI (DCI) |
| **RP projects** | ecosystem-qe | Multiple RP projects across BUs |
| **Teams** | 1 developer | Multi-team, multi-BU |
| **OpenShift versions** | 4.14–4.22 | Current + N-2 supported releases |
| **Test frameworks** | Ginkgo | Ginkgo, pytest, JUnit, custom harnesses |
| **Failure domains** | Test logic, infrastructure, product bugs | + flaky detection, environment drift, dependency conflicts, upgrade regressions |

Every design decision should ask: "Does this work for one operator, or for N operators? For one CI system, or for any CI system?" The abstraction boundaries rule (`rules/universal/abstraction-boundaries.mdc`) enforces this — but the soul is why.

## The telco QE landscape

For context, this is the world Asterisk operates in:

- **CNF features deploy** (`cnf-features-deploy`) — job definitions for all telco operators, deployment manifests, CI profiles
- **Far-edge vRAN tests** — workloads at the network edge, latency-sensitive, hardware-dependent
- **Precision Time Protocol** — nanosecond-accurate time synchronization for 5G RAN, our current calibration domain
- **ReportPortal** — open source (Apache 2.0), 85M+ test launches/year, 1,700+ companies, the shared quality dashboard
- **Jira (OCPBUGS, CNF)** — bug tracking with human-verified ground truth, the authority on what actually went wrong
- **OpenShift Container Platform** — the substrate everything runs on, versions 4.x, with operator-managed lifecycle

## Relationship to ReportPortal

Asterisk is an **external client** of ReportPortal, not a plugin or embedded component. This is deliberate:

- RP is an open source project with its own governance and roadmap
- Asterisk consumes RP data via the public API and contributes RCA results back
- If Asterisk's analysis improves RP's own ML-based auto-analysis, that improvement should flow upstream
- The relationship is collaborative, not dependent — Asterisk works with RP, not inside RP
