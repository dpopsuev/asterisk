description: Naming and classification rules for .cursor artifacts
---

# Taxonomy

## File naming
- Use kebab-case: `dev-flow.md`, `data-io.mdc`.
- Use `.mdc` for Cursor guidance and rules.
- Use `.md` for general notes or long references unless guidance must always apply.

## Classification
- `rules/`: always-apply constraints.
- `guide/`: workflows and process.
- `docs/`: deep references and long-form.
- `notes/`: short, action-oriented summaries.
- `strategy/`: long-term objectives and invariants.
- `tactics/`: "if X, do Y" playbooks.
- `glossary/`: domain terms and definitions.
- `goals/`: goal checklist + per-goal detail files.

## Indexing
- Every directory has a shallow `index.mdc` listing only direct children.
- Update indexes on any file add/remove/rename.
